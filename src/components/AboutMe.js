                <p>My name is Tana (Owens) Orman. Originally from Texas, I've lived in Aurora, Colorado, for over eight years. I share my home with my husband and our three dogs: Haley (border collie mix), Kelev (Great Pyrenees/Australian cattle dog mix), and Chippy (Pembroke Welsh Corgi).

                My interests include travel, outdoor adventuring, horseback riding, reading, and continual learning. Interesting fact about me: my husband and I have traveled to all seven continents (yes, including Antarctica)!

                I currently attend a full-time coding bootcamp at the University of Denver-Center for Professional Development. My portfolio will be updated as I complete projects.</p>
