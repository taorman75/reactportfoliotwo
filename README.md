# My React Portfolio

Deployed on Heroku at https://powerful-brook-36462.herokuapp.com/

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Description
This is my current React-based portfolio. It includes sections on my projects, about me, my contact information, and a link to my resume on Google Drive. The landing page also has icons that lead to my GitHub and my LinkedIn profile.
